	default n
	help
	  Change the default memory allocation GFP flags so that allocations
	  can fail.

	  By default, kbase memory allocations don't fail. This is consisent
	  with other GPU drivers. However, kbase (i.e. texture memory)
	  allocations are accounted to the process which caused the allocation.
	  This means there's a potential DoS attack an application could make
	  by just allocating lots and lots of memory (E.g. textures). That
	  memory wouldn't be seen as being owned by the malicious/buggy
	  application and so the OOM killer wouldn't kill that app's process.
	  By permitting allocations to fail in low memory situations, we can
	  avoid that DoS attack vector at the cost of GL allocations being able
	  to fail.

	  Turn this on if you're confident your code can handle GL allocations
	  failures.
