TI TPS65090 Charger
===================

Regulator information exists as a subnode within the mfd node for the main
TPS65090 device.

The TPS65090 regulator subnode should be called "charger".

The required properties for the individual regulator nodes are as for
regulator.txt, with the following additions / changes:

Optional properties:
  - regulator-name : If given then a regulator is created for the charger
       control. If omitted then the regulator is not created and the driver
       operates entirely passively.

Example:

power-regulator {
	compatible = "ti,tps65090";
	reg = <0x48>;
	charger {
		regulator-name = "vinchg";
	};
};
